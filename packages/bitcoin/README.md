# Bitcoin Library

This is a library to handle receiving and sending bitcoin in React Native.

## Install:

```
yarn @rsksmart/rif-wallet-bitcoin
// or
npm i  @rsksmart/rif-wallet-bitcoin
```

## How to use:

The documentation for this is missing and needs much improvement. This repository is under development and is subject to change without notice.

### Basic setup:

Please check the tests in order to acquire more knowledge as to what this library is doing.

In short terms, this library can create a BitcoinNetwork class that will allow the developer to use either BIP84 or BIP44 for their own purposes.

You can create addresses with a BIP39 Mnemonic, and also implement a DefaultFetcher interface that will automatically fetch all the balances for that mnemonic.

## Tests:

``
npm run test
``
